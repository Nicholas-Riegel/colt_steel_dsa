A binary search tree (BST):
 - A data structure that maintains elements in a sorted order, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. 
 - Each node in a BST has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. 
 - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
